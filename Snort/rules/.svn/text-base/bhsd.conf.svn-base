#  @brief	BotHunter Scan Detector
# 
#  Purpose:	BHSD detects scans using weights sensitive to malware-specific
#  		scanning behavior.
# 
#  Arguments:	bhsd's "preprocessor" line in snort's configuration file accepts 
#
#	PruneInterval		   240
#       ScannedSuppressTimeWindow  120
#       ScannedTimeWindow	   360
#       IPScannedModerate	     5
#       IPScannedHigh		    10
#       ScannerSuppressTimeWindow   90
#       ScannerTimeWindow	   360
#       IPScannerModerate	     9
#       IPScannerHigh		    20
#  	ScannerFocusThreshold	  0.75
#  	ScannerFocusMinCount	     4
#  	ScannerFocusWeights 1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0	// S M O I focus weights
#       IgnoreScannerList   [IP1,IP2] // IP "scanner" whitelist
#       IgnoreScannedList   [IP1,IP2] // ignore "scans" to these addresses
